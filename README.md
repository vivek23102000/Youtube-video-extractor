# Youtube-video-extractor

# ******// Disclaimer //******

This is just a basic YouTube video extractor which requires just the YouTube channel's ID to be able to work. This project was just created as an experiment. I don't take any responsibility of use of the sources to be implemented in others project. Please use this tool on your own risk. The tool is slow but it is recommended for an average user who do not know how to program the functionality, So that there website is able to get all the videos, again I am not taking any responsibility to use this code in your own project for the perfect work, use the official YouTube website to do this.
By using the code you are agree with the terms above.
Thank You.

# How to use it?
--------------------------
The script contains a variable called 'channelID' which you can replace by the string of the channels ID (You should have the channels "ID" not "Username" which can be changed from the dashboard of the end user(s) channel). 
Then you can see the if statement which actually increases or decreases the amount of the videos which are being fetched you can modify it according to your need.
Then the embedded data should be append to the desired element so change the elements ID or class in the HTML to take the advantage of that...

# Clarifications 
This mini project should only be used as an add-on to your site. It may not work if the videos are private or for any other reasons.
The official API is again recommended for this task and the person who made it is not responsible for unexpected consequences anyway.
