# Youtube-video-extractor

******// Disclaimer //******

This is just a basic YouTube video extractor which requires just the YouTube channel's ID to be able to work. This project was just created as an experiment I don't take any responsibility of use of the sources to be implemented in others project please use this tool on you own risk. The tool is slow but it is recommended for an average user who do not know how to program the functionality so that there website is able to get all the videos, again I am not taking any responsibility to use this code in your own project for the perfect work use the official YouTube website to do this. Thank You.
